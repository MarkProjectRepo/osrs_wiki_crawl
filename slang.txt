2:1: A method used in high-level PvM combat where the player will deal damage to a boss 2 times while only allowing the boss to hit them 1 time in order to minimise the potential damage the boss can deal during a fight. This abbreviation can be used to describe any ratio of damage dealt by the player and the boss.
